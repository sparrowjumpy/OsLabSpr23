**SUMMARY**
1- The first step is to generate a log file of the shell/terminal session using the "script" command. This will record all the commands entered and their output during the session. Then, the user is instructed to try out 7 basic Linux commands and save the log file to GitHub.

2- The user is then asked to learn how to use the "apt" package manager in Ubuntu and install the "tree" package using the sudo and apt commands.

3- Next, the user is instructed to start another log session and try out the "tree" command in the terminal. The output of the command should then be saved to a text file named "labtask03.text" using the ">" concatenation symbol. Finally, the user should save the log file and text file to GitHub.

4- The user is then asked to start a new log script and try to create two new users using only terminal/shell commands. Then, the user should log in to one of the users.

5- The user should then change the password of the second user while logged in to the first user's account. The user should then save the script and screenshot to GitHub and explain how they accomplished this.

6- Finally, the user should start a new log script and create a new text file using the vim command. They should type in 10 vocabulary words, save and close vim. Then, using the shell sort command, the user should sort the file and concatenate the output to a new file named "ltSort06.txt". The user should then save this file, along with screenshots, report, and script to GitHub.
