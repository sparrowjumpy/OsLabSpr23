Task1: 
The program will create child processes every 0.2 seconds until the maximum number of child processes (10000) is reached or an error occurs. Each child process will print its ID and parent's ID after sleeping for 1 second, and will terminate after 30 seconds. The parent process will wait for all child processes to terminate.
